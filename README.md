# inter-bot
A collaborative Discord bot created for a private server, with lots of miscellaneous functionality, including:
- storing and fetching files from a dedicated Google Drive account (within account storage limits)
- setting up Secret Santa giveaways
- daily messages, timers
- limited moderation features
- Automated LoL clash team scouting

The bot interfaces with Discord, Gdrive, Riot and LCU (League of Legends Client) APIs. It is not endorsed by any of the owners of said APIs, 
and we do not claim ownership of any content these APIs provide.

As a small and unofficial development group, our methods and knowledge are limited, but we make our best effort 
to insulate all endpoints against errors, including issues of data anonymity and rate limiting.

Feel free to contact Sizzle (sizzlefrostindeed@gmail.com, or `SihinÃ¤halla#1676` on Discord) for matters of API term compliance, feature requests or anything else really ;)
